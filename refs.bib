@article{Rosin:2011uu,
	abstract = {A multi-armed bandit episode consists of n trials, each allowing selection of one of K arms, resulting in payoff from a distribution over {$[$}0,1{$]$} associated with that arm. We assume contextual side information is available at the start of the episode. This context enables an arm predictor to identify possible favorable arms, but predictions may be imperfect so that they need to be combined with further exploration during the episode. Our setting is an alternative to classical multi-armed bandits which provide no contextual side information, and is also an alternative to contextual bandits which provide new context each individual trial. Multi-armed bandits with episode context can arise naturally, for example in computer Go where context is used to bias move decisions made by a multi-armed bandit algorithm. The UCB1 algorithm for multi-armed bandits achieves worst-case regret bounded by {\$}O{$\backslash$}left({$\backslash$}sqrt{\{}Kn{$\backslash$}log(n){\}}{$\backslash$}right){\$}. We seek to improve this using episode context, particularly in the case where K is large. Using a predictor that places weight Mi > 0 on arm i with weights summing to 1, we present the PUCB algorithm which achieves regret {\$}O{$\backslash$}left({$\backslash$}frac{\{}1{\}}{\{}M{\_}{\{}{$\backslash$}ast{\}}{\}}{$\backslash$}sqrt{\{}n{$\backslash$}log(n){\}}{$\backslash$}right){\$}where M ∗is the weight on the optimal arm. We illustrate the behavior of PUCB with small simulation experiments, present extensions that provide additional capabilities for PUCB, and describe methods for obtaining suitable predictors for use with PUCB.},

	abstract = {Deep reinforcement learning (RL) methods have driven impressive advances in artificial intelligence in recent years, exceeding human performance in domains ranging from Atari to Go to no-limit poker. This progress has drawn the attention of cognitive scientists interested in understanding human learning. However, the concern has been raised that deep RL may be too sample-inefficient -- that is, it may simply be too slow -- to provide a plausible model of how humans learn. In the present review, we counter this critique by describing recently developed techniques that allow deep RL to operate more nimbly, solving problems much more quickly than previous methods. Although these techniques were developed in an AI context, we propose that they may have rich implications for psychology and neuroscience. A key insight, arising from these AI methods, concerns the fundamental connection between fast RL and slower, more incremental forms of learning.},

	abstract = {Abstract In magic-angle spinning, the Hamiltonian of the system changes periodically with time, so the spectrum shows sidebands at multiples of the rotor frequency. This changing Hamiltonian (and hence, the changing Liouvillian) complicates the simulation of the line shape considerably. A simple case is that of a spin-½ with an anisotropic chemical shift, spinning at the magic angle. Perhaps the most famous solutions to this problem of calculating spinning sideband intensities are those of Herzfeld and Berger and Maricq and Waugh, but there are many alternatives. Floquet theory is a very powerful approach, which we describe here. We illustrate the theory by explicit calculation of the sideband patterns. Floquet theory works by expanding the periodic (due to sample spinning) Hamiltonian into a Fourier series. The time-independent Fourier components become the blocks in a much larger, time-independent, effective Hamiltonian. The same can be done with the Liouvillian superoperator. The effective Hamiltonian (or Liouvillian) can then be treated using familiar methods used for time-independent problems. The considerable increase in size of the problem is normally anathema, and it offers no particular benefit in the specific case treated here. The power of the method is its generality. Regardless of the complexity of the time dependence of the Hamiltonian, the Floquet approach is the same. Therefore, learning how to calculate sideband intensities in this way gives us the tools to solve much more difficult problems. {\copyright} 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc. Concepts Magn Reson 13: 159--170, 2001},

Due to the lack of an explicit relationship between SAT and AHT, some discrepancies between the results yielded by these theories have been found, especially in NMR applications. A general equivalence scheme between these two methods is here given in operator form, using a new formulation of SAT in terms of a static diagonalization expansion. The two approaches are thus reconciled and the relationship with static techniques should eventually provide new and simpler convergence criteria for AHT.},

	abstract = {Abstract Understanding the dynamics of electron or nuclear spins during a magnetic resonance experiment requires to solve the Schr{\"o}dinger equation for the spin system considering all contributions to the Hamiltonian from interactions of the spins with each other and their surroundings. In general, this is a difficult task as these interaction terms can be both time-dependent and might not commute with each other. A powerful tool to analytically approximate the time evolution is average Hamiltonian theory, in which a time-independent effective Hamiltonian is taking the place of the time-dependent Hamiltonian. The effective Hamiltonian is subjected to the Magnus expansion, allowing to calculate the effective Hamiltonian to a certain order. The goal of this paper is to introduce average Hamiltonian theory in a rigorous but educational manner. The application to two composite pulses in NMR spectroscopy is used to demonstrate important aspects of average Hamiltonian theory.},

Using a dense electronic spin ensemble of atom-like impurities in diamond, we study non-equilibrium quantum many-body dynamics involving ∼10^6 spins. Specifically, we describe: (1) investigation of thermalization dynamics of a closed quantum system in the presence of long-range interactions and on-site disorder, (2) realization of new non-equilibrium phases of matter, such as discrete time crystals, and (3) probing emergent phase transitions in a driven many-body system. In addition, the high-density spin ensembles in the solid state also show great promise for practical sensing applications. As a practical application of these studies, we demonstrate high sensitivity magnetic-field sensing with fault-tolerant pulsed control. These studies demonstrate that dense electronic spin ensembles in the solid state can be a powerful tool to simulate quantum many-body dynamics, explore new coherent non-equilibrium phenomena and to detect external signals with superior sensitivity and high spectral and spatial resolution.},

	abstract = {Being able to quantify the level of coherent control in a proposed device implementing a quantum information processor (QIP) is an important task for both comparing different devices and assessing a device's prospects with regards to achieving fault-tolerant quantum control. We implement in a liquid-state nuclear magnetic resonance QIP the randomized benchmarking protocol presented by Knill et al (2008 Phys. Rev. A 77 012307). We report an error per randomized π/2 pulse of 1.3$\pm$0.1×10−4 with a single-qubit QIP and show an experimentally relevant error model where the randomized benchmarking gives a signature fidelity decay which is not possible to interpret as a single error per gate. We explore and experimentally investigate multi-qubit extensions of this protocol and report an average error rate for one- and two-qubit gates of 4.7$\pm$0.3×10−3 for a three-qubit QIP. We estimate that these error rates are still not decoherence limited and thus can be improved with modifications to the control hardware and software.},

@article{PARK201668,
	abstract = {Spin systems controlled and probed by magnetic resonance have been valuable for testing the ideas of quantum control and quantum error correction. This paper introduces an X-band pulsed electron spin resonance spectrometer designed for high-fidelity coherent control of electron spins, including a loop-gap resonator for sub-millimeter sized samples with a control bandwidth ∼40MHz. Universal control is achieved by a single-sideband upconversion technique with an I--Q modulator and a 1.2GS/s arbitrary waveform generator. A single qubit randomized benchmarking protocol quantifies the average errors of Clifford gates implemented by simple Gaussian pulses, using a sample of gamma-irradiated quartz. Improvements in unitary gate fidelity are achieved through phase transient correction and hardware optimization. A preparation pulse sequence that selects spin packets in a narrowed distribution of static fields confirms that inhomogeneous dephasing (1/T2∗) is the dominant source of gate error. The best average fidelity over the Clifford gates obtained here is 99.2%, which serves as a benchmark to compare with other technologies.},

@article{Silver1140,
	abstract = {Computers can beat humans at increasingly complex games, including chess and Go. However, these programs are typically constructed for a particular game, exploiting its properties, such as the symmetries of the board on which it is played. Silver et al. developed a program called AlphaZero, which taught itself to play Go, chess, and shogi (a Japanese version of chess) (see the Editorial, and the Perspective by Campbell). AlphaZero managed to beat state-of-the-art programs specializing in these three games. The ability of AlphaZero to adapt to various game rules is a notable step toward achieving a general game-playing system.Science, this issue p. 1140; see also pp. 1087 and 1118The game of chess is the longest-studied domain in the history of artificial intelligence. The strongest programs are based on a combination of sophisticated search techniques, domain-specific adaptations, and handcrafted evaluation functions that have been refined by human experts over several decades. By contrast, the AlphaGo Zero program recently achieved superhuman performance in the game of Go by reinforcement learning from self-play. In this paper, we generalize this approach into a single AlphaZero algorithm that can achieve superhuman performance in many challenging games. Starting from random play and given no domain knowledge except the game rules, AlphaZero convincingly defeated a world champion program in the games of chess and shogi (Japanese chess), as well as Go.},

This methodology is used for designing pulse sequences that maximize the coherence transfer between coupled spins in a given specified time, minimize the relaxation effects in a given coherence transfer step or minimize the time required to produce a given unitary propagator, as desired. The application of these pulse engineering methods to design pulse sequences that are robust to experimentally important parameter variations, such as chemical shift dispersion or radiofrequency (rf) variations due to imperfections such as rf inhomogeneity is also explained.},
