% TODO introduction
% motivation for Hamiltonian engineering in NMR
% RL as new tool that can be applied

% TODO methods
% AlphaZero algorithm
% Adding AHT constraints for improved search/results

% TODO results
% unconstrained search, no errors
% AHT constraints, no errors
% adding errors, better at handling imperfections?
% experimental results

% TODO conclusion/future work
% promising new tool, achieves close to state-of-the-art with minimal knowledge
% better constraints on tree search, further optimization of RL algorithm could lead to novel pulse sequences tailored for specific systems/tasks
